The aim of the game is to spell words with 4 or more letters. Each letter has an associated value, therefore, a player's score for a word is calculated based on these values.

**Rules:**
1. To get a score for a word, the last letter played should start a word in any direction. For example, if the following letters are on the board “tao” and
“b” is placed after “o” then the word become “boat”.
2. The players take turns in placing a letter on the board. Each player must either place a letter on the board or ask to quit the game.
3. The game ends when there are no more empty squares on the board, or when one of the player types
'quit'.
